// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the team looks over the demands of the project and starts to think of how to solve those demands. "
const design ="This is the third step, in which the software engineers brainstorm and start creating plans of attack to tackle any coding problem."
const implementation ='This is the fourth step, in which the team starts putting "pen to paper" and writing out the code and making all their plans come to life.'
const testingAndIntegration ="This is the fifth step, in which the code or application is tested repeatedly and inserted into where ever it needs to go."
const maintain = 'This is the final step but also the first step to repeated the process as applications are constantly changing and need to be updated, usually every 2-4 weeks developers will repeat the steps above to maintain the code.'
